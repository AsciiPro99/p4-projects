# Open source P4 implementations

This repository is used to host the open-source P4 implementations of some of our research projects. 

## Projects
- [AES](AES.p4app/): AES encryption on BMV2 model
- [AES-tofino](AES-tofino/): AES encryption on Tofino switch
- [ONTAS](ONTAS/): Traffic anonymization on BMV2 / Tofino
- [PRECISION-tofino](PRECISION-tofino/): The PRECISION heavy-hitter algorithm on Tofino switch
- [RTT-tofino](RTT-tofino/): TCP Round-Trip Time measurement on Tofino switch

Please refer to individual project sub-folders for open-source licenses.
